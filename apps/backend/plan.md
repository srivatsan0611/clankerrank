# Things to do

- Enqueue problems to be solved
- Enqueue each step (generate problem, generate solution, generate test cases, generate test code, execute test code)
- Test case natural language descriptions should be generated BEFORE solution is generated (such that the solution can be generated with the correct test cases in mind)
