  "description": "Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.\n\nTwo strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.\n\nAll occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.",
